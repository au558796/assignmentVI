### Assignment 2 - Part 1 - Assessing voice in schizophrenia
Can you characterize voice in schizophrenia as acoustically different? Report the methods you used to answer this question and the results from the analyses. Add a couple of lines trying to interpret the results and a couple of lines describing limitations of the data/analyses if any is relevant.
```{r}
#NOTE TO SELF:
# Recurrance rate - how much is covered in black? (%)
# Determinisim - stability of repetitions, how likely black dot is not isolated,but part of a diagonal (keeps repeating)
# NR Line = total number of lines in recurrance plot
# L - how long do shared directories go together?
# Lmax - maximum trajectory
# Entropy - when system repeats itself? How unpredictable?
# Laminarity - Verticle patterns (getting stuck)
# Trapping Time - how long you are 'trapped' in the state (verticle)

##1. In the course of this assignment you have to first select one datafile and figure out how to:

##Extract "standard" descriptors of pitch: Mean, standard deviation, range

summary.list = function(x){
  result<-c(
  Mean=mean(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  Median=median(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  Max.Min=range(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  Range=max(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE) - min(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  Variance=var(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  Std.Dev=sd(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE),
  IQR=IQR(x$f0, na.rm = TRUE),
  MeanAbsDev=aad(x$f0, na.rm = TRUE),
  Coeff.Variation.Prcnt=sd(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE)/mean(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE)*100,
  Std.Error=sd(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(length(x$f0[!is.na(x)])),
  Quantile=quantile(x$f0, na.rm=TRUE)
  )
return(result)
}

p = read.delim(pitch_list[1])
summary.list(p)

##Extract "complex" descriptors: recurrence quantification analysis

#par
par = list(lgM =  10, steps = seq(1, 6, 1),  radiusspan = 100,  radiussample = 40, normalize = 0,  rescale = 0,  mindiagline = 2,  minvertline = 2,  tw = 0,  whiteline = FALSE,  recpt = FALSE,  fnnpercent = 10,  typeami = 'mindip')

#optimized parameters
try(optimizeParam(p$f0, p$f0, par, min.rec = 1, max.rec = 10))

#rqa
rqa_analysis= function(x)(  
  crqa(x, x, embed = 11, delay = 9, normalize = 0, rescale = 0, radius = 2,
  mindiagline = 2, minvertline = 1)
)
rqa_analysis(p)

##2. Second you will have to turn the code into a function and loop through all the files (or even better use apply/sapply/lapply)
##- Remember to extract the relevant information from the file names (Participant, Diagnosis, Trial, Study)

rm(dframe)
folder = file.path(path)
pitch_list<- list.files(path = folder, recursive = TRUE, pattern = "*f0.txt")
std = NULL
mean = NULL
study = NULL
range = NULL
median = NULL
iqr = NULL
mad = NULL
rqa = NULL
id = NULL
diagnosis = NULL
trial = NULL
Diagnosis = NULL

RR = NULL
DET = NULL

maxL = NULL
L = NULL

x = NULL
N = 1


for (i in pitch_list) {
  x = read.delim(i, header = T)
  x = x$f0
  id = str_extract(i, "S+\\d+")
  id[N] = str_extract(id,"\\d+")
  diagnosis[N] = str_extract(str_extract(i,"D+\\d"), "\\d")
  trial[N] = str_extract(str_extract(i,"T+\\d"), "\\d")
  study[N] = str_extract(i, "\\d")
  range[N] = range(x,na.rm = T)
  mean[N] = mean(x,na.rm = T)
  variance[N] = var(x, na.rm=TRUE)
  std[N] = std(x)
  median[N] = median(x, na.rm = T)
  iqr[N] = IQR(x,na.rm = T)
  mad[N] = mad(x,na.rm = T)
  rqa = crqa(x,x, embed = 2, delay = 1, normalize = 0, rescale = 0, radius = 0.5, mindiagline = 2, minvertline = 1)
  RR[N] = rqa$RR
  DET[N] = rqa$DET
  NRLINE[N] = rqa$NRLINE
  maxL[N] = rqa$maxL
  L[N] = rqa$L
  ENTR[N] = rqa$ENTR
  rENTR[N] = rqa$rENTR
  LAM[N] = rqa$LAM
  TT[N] = rqa$TT
  N = N+1
}

dframe = data.frame(id,study,diagnosis,trial,range,mean,variance,std,median,mad,RR,DET,NRLINE,maxL,L,ENTR,rENTR,LAM,TT)

write.csv(dframe, "schizoData.csv")

##3. Make one model per acoustic feature and test whether you can observe significant difference due to Diagnosis.
# Tip: Which other fixed factors should you control for (that is, include in the model)? Which random ones?

# RR = Recurrence rate
# DET = Determinism
# L = L
# maxL = Maximum trajectory
# ENTR = Entropy
# LAM = Laminarity
# TT = Trapping Time
# NRLINE = Total number of lines

m_RR = lmer(RR ~ diagnosis + trial + study +  diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_DET = lmer(DET ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_L = lmer(L ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_maxL = lmer(maxL ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_ENTR = lmer(ENTR ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_LAM = lmer(LAM ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_TT = lmer(TT ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

m_NRLINE = lmer(NRLINE ~ diagnosis + trial + study + diagnosis*study + (1|study) + (1|id), data = dframe, REML = FALSE)

#oh my god I am dyingggggggg

##3a. Is study a significant predictor in these models? What should you infer from this? Does study interact with diagnosis? What should you infer from this?
